# Technoskill 2.0 Workshop – Mobile Robot Project

## Description
This project was developed as part of Technoskill 2.0 workshop held by IME FTUI x AMV UI. The focus of this project is to build a mobile robot car using a microcontroller-based system.  
The project emphasises mechanical design, hardware integration, and basic control systems.

**Achievement:**  
Winner of **Best Design** at Technoskill 2.0.

## Project Objectives
- Learn the fundamentals of mobile robot development  
- Integrate a microcontroller with actuators  
- Implement basic control logic  
- Optimise mechanical design for stability and efficiency  

## Tools & Components
### Hardware
- ESP (ESP8266 / ESP32)
- DC Motors
- Servo Motor
- Mobile robot chassis
- Power supply/battery

### Software
- Arduino IDE
- ESP and Servo libraries

## System Overview
- The ESP acts as the main controller of the robot  
- DC motors function as the primary driving system  
- The servo motor is used for steering or additional actuation  
- Control logic is implemented and uploaded to the ESP via Arduino IDE  

## My Role
- Assembled the mechanical components of the robot  
- Integrated hardware components (ESP, motors, servo)  
- Participated in testing and design optimisation
- Contributed to achieving the Best Design award
